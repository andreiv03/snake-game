# Snake Game

An **embedded C++ Snake Game** designed for LED matrix displays and microcontroller environments like **ESP32** or **Arduino**. This modular, lightweight game demonstrates core principles of game logic, hardware interfacing, and real-time updates.

Built for **expandability** and **hardware abstraction**, it's ideal for learning embedded game development or deploying a quick retro game on custom hardware.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay** ‚Äì Move, grow, and avoid collisions in a nostalgic arcade style.
- **LED Matrix Display Support** ‚Äì Renders gameplay on a low-power LED matrix screen.
- **Menu Interface** ‚Äì Basic game menu for starting or resetting the game.
- **Customizable Settings** ‚Äì Modify game speed, display behavior, and more.
- **Hardware Abstraction** ‚Äì Supports RTC, buttons, and other hardware components.
- **PlatformIO Integration** ‚Äì Easily build and deploy using the PlatformIO ecosystem.

## ‚ö° Technology Stack

- **C++ (C++11 or later)** ‚Äì Main language for control logic and game implementation.
- **PlatformIO** ‚Äì Manages builds, libraries, and hardware targets.
- **Microcontroller Hardware** ‚Äì Designed for platforms like ESP32.
- **LED Matrix** ‚Äì Visual game rendering using simple pixel-based output.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Installation

### Prerequisites

Before building the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PlatformIO IDE** (or CLI)
- A compatible microcontroller board (e.g., ESP32)
- Required hardware (e.g., LED matrix, buttons, RTC)

### Build Instructions

Follow these steps to clone, build, and run the HTTP client:

```sh
